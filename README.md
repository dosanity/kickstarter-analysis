# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Louise is an up and coming playright who wants to kickstart a crowd funding campaign to help fund her play, *Fever*. She estimates that her budget will be around $10000 to $12000. Louise is seeking assistance so that she can successfully launch her first crowdfunding campaign. We will analyze and interpret public crowd funding campaign data to see if there are specific factors that will make a crowdfunding campaign successful. We will use these insights to help best support Louise so that she can kickstart a successful campaign for her play, *Fever*.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In our first analysis, we used Microsoft Excel to examine data from a public crowd funding website with a sample size of 4114 different campaigns. From this data, we generated a pivot table to separate campaigns that were successful, that failed, and those that were canceled. Additionally, we filtered out the data to only display theatrical crowdfunding campaigns since we are comparing plays with their launch dates. Using the resulting data, we constructed a line chart to visualize theater outcomes based on their launch dates.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
In our second analysis, we also used Microsoft Excel to examine data from a public crowd funding website with a sample size of 4114 different campaigns. From this data, we separated the funding goal amounts into 12 different categories. Moreover, we calculated the percentages of successful, failed, and canceled theatrical plays based on these distinct intervals of funding goal amounts. Using the percentages of the outcomes, we constructed a line chart to visualize the different outcomes based on funding goal amounts for theatrical plays.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
There were no challenges or difficulties encountered in this analysis. There could have been potential challenges in filtering and cleaning the data. Cleaning the data is vital to getting more accurate results and accidently adding or removing a data set can alter the outcome. Additionally, there are a plethora of distinct formulas in Microsoft Excel and it is impossible to memorize them all. To overcome this challenge, we can look up the specific formula and research its use to be more efficient.

## Results
- From the Theater Outcomes based on Launch Date line chart, we can conclude that the month of May had the most successful crowdfunding campaign outcomes. During that month, there were 111 successful campaigns. We can also conclude that the month of December had the lowest successful crowdfunding campaign outcomes. During the month of December, only 37 kickstarters were successful. Furthermore, failed crowdfunding campaigns remained consistently higher during the summer months (between May - August) compared to other months except for October.
- From the Outcomes based on Goals line chart, we can conclude that there are more successful campaigns compared to failed campaigns for any funding goal amount less than $15000 and between $35000 to $44999. The percentage of successful campaigns equal the percentage of failed campaigns when the funding goal amount is between $15000 to $19999. 
- One limitation of this dataset include a dramatic decrease in data through filtering. From the analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date, the sample size decreased from 4114 to 1369 and from the analysis of Outcomes based on Goals, our sample size is 1047. Although the sample size is still considered large, the analysis is less acurate compared to a larger sample size since it is considered further from the true population size. Another limitation is the source of the data. Since the process of data collection is unknown, it can cause deficiencies in data measurements resulting in a bias analysis.
- Although we were able to analyze and interpret information to help Louise with crowdfunding for her play, there are other potential tables and graphs we can create. We can research which country has the most successful crowdfunding campaign or see if spotlight correlates with successful campaigns. Both can be represented as a bar graph. If Louise's main focus was to look have a successful campaign, we can branch out of the theater category and examine other category statistics. By using a bar chart, we can investigate the percentages of successful crowdfunding campaign outcomes compare to failed campaign outcomes in each category to help find the most optimal category with the highest percentage of successes.
